## Hey there, welcome to my github page!

### ✨ My goals for 2024
 - ✔️ Release my Minecraft Client to the public ( [Click Here!](https://github.com/Clueeng/Flauxy2) )
 - ◻ Finish my interpreted language

### 💻 The languages I know
- Java, I initially started programming in java, making custom clients for minecraft
- Python, pretty basic understanding, not too advanced
- C#, I've made a few applets using C#, nothing astonishing, but still worth mentioning! 

### 🥰 Things I like (not specifically programming related)
- 🎮 Minecraft, and its internal functioning, I've established myself as knowledgeable since I've been able to find a pretty big bug in Optifine (and find its cause) that had been lying there dormant for years
- 🎧 Music! I love music, and I listen to MANY genres
- ⌨️ Keyboards. May sound silly but I really like keyboards, and their customizability
